## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Manifest v2** chosen for broader Firefox compatibility
- **Message Passing** between background, content, and popup scripts
- **Local Storage** for settings and chat history persistence
- **Modular Design** with separate files for different functionalities

### API Integrations
- **LM Studio API** - Local HTTP API at `http://localhost:1234/v1`
- **Wikipedia API** - Primary search source with CORS support
- **DuckDuckGo API** - Secondary search source for additional results

### Security Considerations
- All data stored locally in Firefox browser storage
- No personal data sent to external servers (except public search APIs)
- User consent required for extensive browser permissions
- Settings allow users to disable internet search features

### Future Development
- Version 0.0.2 will focus on advanced agentic features
- Research and automation capabilities expansion
- Enhanced AI-powered browser interactions
- Academic and professional research tools
